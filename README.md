# CAN-Based-Automotive-Dashboard
CAN-based automotive dashboard system for real-time vehicle data monitoring and communication using the CAN protocol.

The CAN Based Automotive Dashboard is an embedded systems project designed to monitor and display vehicle parameters through Controller Area Network (CAN) communication. The system enables reliable real-time data exchange between multiple electronic control units (ECUs), allowing dashboard information to be updated accurately and efficiently.

This project demonstrates the implementation of CAN protocol, embedded C programming, real-time communication, and automotive system design concepts.
